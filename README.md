## Learnings:
I really enjoyed developing this tool. 
My original objective was to kickstart a business that would take in input data from a website, use this tool to generate the pdf, and send it to a print queue, where I could then mail them out.
However, I soon encountered the intricate landscape of sole proprietorship startup costs, maitenance costs, legal requirements, quartly individual tax implications, and copyright and liability considerations.

A significant revelation during this venture was the cost breakdown, highlighting that ink and postage were the primary cost drivers in label production. 
After conducting a detailed financial analysis, it became apparent that maintaining a reasonable profit margin would be challenging without unreasonable pricing.
Consequently, I made the decision to shelve the business idea.

Nevertheless, I remained committed to releasing the code, offering individuals the opportunity to save money by printing labels at home.
I take great satisfaction in the development of this tool and hope that it proves beneficial to others, enabling them to efficiently manage their labeling needs.
